##  EDA Steps
1. **Data Overview** – Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()` to understand structure and missing values.  
2. **Univariate Analysis** – Examined individual variable distributions using histograms and boxplots.  
3. **Bivariate Analysis** – Explored relationships using scatterplots and boxplots.  
4. **Multivariate Analysis** – Used `sns.heatmap()` and `sns.pairplot()` to detect correlations and interactions.  
5. **Outlier Detection** – Identified extreme values using boxplots.  
6. **Insights Summary** – Highlighted trends, anomalies, and relationships for decision-making.

##  Key Insights
- Some variables showed strong positive correlations.  
- Few outliers detected in numerical data.  
- Certain categories influence target variable more than others.  
- Data is mostly clean and ready for modeling.

##  Outcome
Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Finding patterns and trends in real data  
- Cleaning and visualizing data  
- Interpreting statistical and visual outputs  
- Communicating findings effectively
